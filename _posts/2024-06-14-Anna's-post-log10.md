The Collection Builder workshop went well today, it was fun to build our own exhibition site. However, the workshop was also challenging and I would like to improve more on how to use the tool. There are lots of files that we start with so it will take a while to find and navigate through them and Im still getting a hang of the code in the files. I think it would be better if the steps in the walk through expained the lines of code they tell us to add more.
